## 💡 The Discovery

### The “Unknown Product” Concept
The idea behind Route Navigator emerged from exploring the **“unknown product”** — an **unseen need** for guidance and clarity during transit. Commuters often rely on strangers for navigation, asking questions like:
> “Where can I board the next bus?” or “Where should I drop?”

This social habit highlights a **dependence on others for direction**, especially in unfamiliar environments.  
Route Navigator replaces that dependency with a **personal digital guide** that provides:
- Real-time navigation assistance  
- Visual route maps  
- AI-powered conversational support  

It transforms **the unknown journey into a known path**, allowing users to make informed decisions about where to board, alight, and navigate confidently.

### Key Challenges

- Inconsistent bus routes and stop naming  
- Difficulty identifying correct boarding points and alighting stops
